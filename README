This repository contains a set of structures and routines for extracting information about lipid bilayer membranes from molecular dynamics simulations.

The initial versions are designed to get information from simulations of a membrane using the Martini_3 forcefield in Gromacs. However, the objective is to be forcefield and molecular dynamics engine agnostic and collect information from trajectory files and structure files.

Top level concepts and ideas.
* A bilayer is composed of two (more or less well defined) leaflets.
* A leaflet is composed of a set of residues, each of which is composed of "atoms"
* In a periodic box the bilayer can be continuous in 0, 1 or 2 axes
